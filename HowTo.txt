The program is simple: In a first stage you enter the number of the players,

their names and the individual initiative-modifier for each of them (for both human and npc).

Later, after the first round (in which all characters got organized) you reach the menu where you are able to:

-Start the next round.
-Kill a character so it doesnt appear on the next round.
-Revive a character so it appears again in the nex round.
-Change the initiative-modifier for any of the players.
-End the current game.
